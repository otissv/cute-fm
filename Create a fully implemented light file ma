Create a fully implemented light file manager based on eza and fzf. Using bubbletea and lipgloss. Without demo or partial code.

the UI consists of a left panel and a right panel and a search bar. The search bar is a bubble textinput input field and the left is a bubble table in a scrollable bubble viewport and the right panel is a bubble viewport containing a preview of the selected file/folder.

The left panel is the file system list and the right panel is the file/folder content.

When a file is selected in the left panel, the right panel is updated to show the file content with syntax highlighting. If the file is an image, it is displayed in the right panel. If the file is a video, it is displayed in the right panel. If the file is a audio, it is displayed in the right panel. If the file is a document, it is displayed in the right panel. If the file is a code, it is displayed in the right panel with syntax highlighting. If the file is a binary, it is displayed in the right panel as a binary file. If the file is a symlink, it is displayed in the right panel as a symlink. If the file is a socket, it is displayed in the right panel as a socket. If the file is a pipe, it is displayed in the right panel as a pipe. If the file is a device, it is displayed in the right panel as a device. 

When a directory is selected in the left panel, the right panel is updated to show the directory content. If the directory is empty, a message is displayed in the right panel saying "Directory is empty". If the directory is not empty, the files and directories in the directory are displayed in the right panel.


left panel format should be:
